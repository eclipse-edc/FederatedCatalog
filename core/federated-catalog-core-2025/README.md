This module contains implementations for the Federated Catalog Cache, which is a database that contains a snapshot of
all the catalogs offered by all the connectors in a dataspace.

It collects those catalogs using `Crawler` objects that run periodically.

**This module is currently under development and should not be considered stable!**
